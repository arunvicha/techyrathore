            <p>HOW TO STOP MELACARE SAFELY STEP BY STEP
first if you are using it for more than six monts please stop it because it is not a
whitining cream it is used for some other treatments and many countries had banned this
product because of its sideeffects and if you are the one who used this cream and want to
stop it safely with out any harmfull effects then this is the solution for it
first do not stop in just one day its a one month procedure and for this you need
the best alternatives for creams like this and that is kojic acid,arbutin etc...
and in my experience the best would be kojic acid so you need a cream called
kojic acid cream for this one month procedure for your knowing i am given the image of this cream below
so first week procedure
first day melacare
second dat kojic
third day again melacare
fourts day kojic and so on for the first week
now for the second week
first day melacare
second day kojic
third day again kojic
fourth day melacare
like this shortage the use of melacare and use kojic twice for the second week
now for the third week
first day melacare
second day kojic
third day kojic
fourth day kojic
fifth day again melacare
sixth and seventh day again kojic
now for the last week
first day melacare
second third fourth and fifth day kojic then use melacare and then slightly
stop using melecare and apply only kojic for the next month with out using melacare
and thus using this procedure you can get back you skin safely without any harmfull
side effects if you think this helped you do subscribe my youtube channel TECHY RATHORE
